/**
 * Stage D — HubSpot companies + deals + Fireflies note enrichment
 *
 * Pulls ~922 active customer companies from HubSpot, their associated deals,
 * and their most recent Fireflies-processed note. Haiku-enriches each note
 * for sentiment + topics + action items. Writes to pipeline_state stage='D'.
 *
 * Scheduled in vercel.json: 22:00 UTC daily (parallel to A/B/C).
 *
 * Optional — silently no-ops when HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN is unset. Compose will
 * still produce a snapshot; HubSpot fields on each ScoredCustomerV2 just stay
 * null. Manual trigger: curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" .../api/cron/refresh/stage-d
