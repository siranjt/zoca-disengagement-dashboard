/**
 * Phase 2.0 — this route is now an alias for /api/cron/refresh/compose.
 *
 * Earlier versions ran the entire pipeline (fetches + score + write) in one
 * function. That exceeded Vercel Hobby's 60s timeout and OOM ceiling on
 * variable cold starts. Phase 2.0 split fetching into 3 independent cron
 * functions (stage-a, stage-b, stage-c) that write pipeline_state to
 * Postgres. This route now just runs `compose`, which reads those states.
 *
 * For automatic daily refresh, vercel.json schedules:
 *   - stage-a, stage-b, stage-c at 22:00 UTC (parallel)
 *   - this route (compose) at 22:05 UTC (5 min buffer)
 *
 * Manual trigger: hit /api/cron/refresh/{stage-a,stage-b,stage-c} first,
 * then this route. Or this route alone if stages already ran today.
